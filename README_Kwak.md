## Overview

### Hardware Requirements

### Software Requirements


## Processing your own Scenes

If you need to create colmap data yourself, you can use ```convert.py``` . To perform ```convert.py``` , you must configure the data directory as follows.

```
<location>
|---input
    |---<image 0>
    |---<image 1>
    |---...
```
 If you have COLMAP on your system path, now you can simply run

```shell
python convert.py -s <location>
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for convert.py</span></summary>

  #### --no_gpu
  Flag to avoid using GPU in COLMAP.
  #### --skip_matching
  Flag to indicate that COLMAP info is available for images.
  #### --source_path / -s
  Location of the inputs.
  #### --camera 
  Which camera model to use for the early matching steps, ```OPENCV``` by default.
  #### --resize
  Flag for creating resized versions of input images.
  #### --colmap_executable
  Path to the COLMAP executable (```.bat``` on Windows).
  #### --magick_executable
  Path to the ImageMagick executable.
</details>
<br>

Our COLMAP loaders expect the following dataset structure in the source path location:

```
<location>
|---images
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---sparse
    |---0
        |---cameras.bin
        |---images.bin
        |---points3D.bin
```
If you have mirror mask dataset and want to get mirror plane equation by using these mask datasets, just add the "masks" directory like below.
(Mask dataset should represent mirror plane by "white" and the other part by "black"):
```
<location>
|---images
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---masks
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---sparse
    |---0
        |---cameras.bin
        |---images.bin
        |---points3D.bin
```

## Running

To run the train.py, use one out of two below

```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> --render_mask True # if you have mirror mask datasets, and you want to get mirror plane equation

python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> # when you don't have mask datasets or don't need to get mirror plane equation (render_mask=False is default)

```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for train.py</span></summary>

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --model_path / -m 
  Path where the trained model should be stored (```output/<random>``` by default).
  #### --render_mask
  Make it ```True```, if you want to get the mirror mask rendering and the mirror plane equation (```False``` by default)

  #### --eval
  Add this flag to use a MipNeRF360-style training/test split for evaluation.

For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. **If not set and input image width exceeds 1.6K pixels, inputs are automatically rescaled to this target.**
  #### --data_device
  Specifies where to put the source image data, ```cuda``` by default, recommended to use ```cpu``` if training on large/high-resolution dataset, will reduce VRAM consumption, but slightly slow down training. Thanks to [HrsPythonix](https://github.com/HrsPythonix).

  #### --debug_from
  Debugging is **slow**. You may specify an iteration (starting from 0) after which the above debugging becomes active.
  #### --iterations
  Number of total iterations to train for, ```30_000``` by default.

## Rendering
To run the render.py, use one out of two below

```shell
python render.py -m <path to trained model> --render_mask True # if you trained with render_mask=True, it can be also set True in render.py (you will get rendered mirror mask)

python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> # if you trained with render_mask=False, you must set False in render.py (Although you trained with render_mask=True, you can set False if you want to)

## Evaluation
By default, the trained models use all available images in the dataset. To train them while withholding a test set for evaluation, use the ```--eval``` flag. This way, you can render training/test sets and produce error metrics as follows:
```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> -- --render_mask True # Train with train/test split, Set render_mask True if needed
python render.py -m <path to trained model> --render_mask True # Generate renderings, Set render_mask True if needed
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
```

  #### --model_paths / -m 
  Space-separated list of model paths for which metrics should be computed.

## Interactive Viewers
We provide two interactive viewers for our method: remote and real-time. Our viewing solutions are based on the [SIBR](https://sibr.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) framework, developed by the GRAPHDECO group for several novel-view synthesis projects.

### Running the Real-Time Viewer
https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/assets/40643808/0940547f-1d82-4c2f-a616-44eabbf0f816

After extracting or installing the viewers, you may run the compiled ```SIBR_gaussianViewer_app[_config]``` app in ```<SIBR install dir>/bin```, e.g.: 
```shell
./<SIBR install dir>/bin/SIBR_gaussianViewer_app -m <path to trained model>
```
